# Signature-Maker
Simple AOB to Signature & Mask Converter for my projects.

**Don't use * instead of ??.**

Type your array of bytes and click convert button to get your signature and mask.

For example this is our address:
8B 83 9D 00 ?? 00 D1

<img src="/Images/sigconv.png" width="400"/>

and this is the result.
